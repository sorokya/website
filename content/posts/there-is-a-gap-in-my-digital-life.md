I got my first personal computer in the mid 2000s. It was a Christmas gift from my grandparents. One of those old Dell towers that came preinstalled with Windows XP. Of course this wasn't my first time using a PC, but this PC was mine.

All I really did on that thing at first was log on Myspace and Pogo games. I played runescape from time to time but it never really caught my attention. One day a friend from school
made a post on the myspace bulletin linking to another MMORPG he was playing called Endless Online. I downloaded the client, made an account and chracter, and started a journey that
would span multiple years and countless friendships.

Endless Online was a social game. The combat was there for something to do, but the main purpose of the game was to socialize and explore the vibrant and colorful world.
The world was full of hidden paths that only the experiences player might know about. You were bound to make friends in this environment. Offering help to newbies, or asking for
help yourself. I started my journey in EO like everyone did. I total Newb. Level 1 on "Newb Island". 

As I played EO I made a lot of friends. I think this was my first experience in building an online friendship. The game even had a built in Friend List and Ignore List. So you
could keep track of when your friends were online, and block jerks from talking to you.

The first person I remember playing with was all the way back on Newb Island. I think he his character name was something like Darkrikux.
His play style was to stay on the island and help other players out. He never mentioned having other characters
