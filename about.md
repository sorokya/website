### What games do I play?
My all time favorite game is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. I used to stream speedruns of it a couple of years ago but haven't in a long time. I still play around offline from time to time. Lately I've been doing [randomizers](https://www.ootrandomizer.com/).

I use an [EverDrive64](https://krikzz.com/store/) to play randomizer and rom hacks on my Nintendo 64.

You can follow me on [twitch.tv/sorokya](https://twitch.tv/sorokya) but I haven't streamed in a very long time, and don't plan to for now.

These are the games I'm currently playing
* Doom Eternal
* Animal Crossing: New Horizons
* [Endless Online](http://game.eoserv.net)
