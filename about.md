### About Me
I'm just a tech loving nerd. I've been working as a programmer making cloud based business management software since 2013. I'm interested in working on my own projects but never get anything done.

### What software do I use?
* OS: Arch Linux 
* WM: i3-gaps  
* Bar: polybar
* Launcher: rofi  
* Browser: Firefox with [addons](firefoxaddons.html) and [hardened settings](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config)
* Terminal: Alacritty 
* Editor: Vim 
* Media Player: VLC/Plex 
* Password Manager: Keepass 
* Email: [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) 

One of these days I'd like to get my dotfiles on a git repo.

### What games do I play?
My all time favorite game is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. I used to stream speedruns of it a couple of years ago but haven't in a long time. I still play around offline from time to time. Lately I've been doing [randomizers](https://www.ootrandomizer.com/).

I use an [EverDrive64](https://krikzz.com/store/) to play randomizer and rom hacks on my Nintendo 64.

You can follow me on [twitch.tv/sorokya](https://twitch.tv/sorokya) but I haven't streamed in a very long time, and don't plan to for now.

These are the games I'm currently playing
* Spider-man (PS4)
* Mario Maker 2
